## Project Description

Our team decided to create a to-do app. We wanted to have a place where we could add to-do items and be able to edit them and mark them as complete. We then though about adding a number value so we could prioritize items and give them a visual reference of the priority. Finally, we added a to-do view and a completed view, in order to only see relevant to-do's.

We developed the app using MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, React and Node, and are able to perform full CRUD operations to the database in order to add, edit and delete to-do items.

## API

We are building our own API with MongoDB, Mongoose and Express. The backend is deployed using AtlasDB and [Heroku](https://stark-depths-63601.herokuapp.com/tasks/). In order to maintain data consistency we developed a schema. This allows us to always save our data in the same format. Here's an example of how the data is returned:

    {
    	"title": "First to-do",
    	"body": "This is the body of the to do",
    	"createdDate": "2020-08-18",
    	"priority": 1,
    	"completed": false,
    	"completedDate": "2020-08-18",
    	"dueDate": "due date string"
    },
    {
    	"title": "First to-do",
    	"body": "This is the body of the to do",
    	"priority": 1,
    	"createdDate": "2020-08-18",
    	"dueDate": "due date string",
    	"completed": false,
    	"completedDate": "2020-08-18"
    }
